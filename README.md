# üöÄ GenAI Learning Series - Practical Lab üî¨

Welcome to my **Generative AI Practical Repository**!  
This repo is a live showcase of my hands-on journey into GenAI ‚Äî from curiosity to capability. Every notebook here is part of a real project, tutorial, or concept I've learned, built, and shared as part of my personal mission to master AI.

## üí° Why I Built This
I don‚Äôt come from a fancy tech background.  
I‚Äôm not a PhD or engineer.

But I had one thing: **a hunger to build real AI projects**.  
This repo is proof that anyone can go from learner to builder ‚Äî if they show up daily.

If you‚Äôve ever felt behind in AI, this repo is your roadmap to get started.
